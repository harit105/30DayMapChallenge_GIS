# 3D Terrain Mapping
3D Terrain Mapping is a Geographic Information System (GIS) technique used to visualize the Earth's surface in three dimensions. This method involves creating a digital representation of terrain surfaces, which can be used for various applications such as urban planning, landscape analysis, and environmental studies. By leveraging 3D models, users can gain a more intuitive understanding of topography, elevations, and landforms.

# Procedural Terrain Using Three.js and WebGL
This project explores 3D visualization and interactivity with procedural terrain using Three.js and WebGL. While not based on real-world data, it dynamically generates terrain with custom shaders and real-time effects.

# Highlights:
Custom Shaders: Applies textures like sand, grass, and snow.
Real-Time Rendering: Includes shadows, reflections, and lighting.
# Next Steps
Integrating Real-World GIS Data: Use Mapbox or Google Maps Elevation API to create terrains from actual geospatial data.

Augmented Reality (AR): Implement AR with WebXR to enable interactive, real-world overlays of terrains and geospatial layers.
# Why It Matters?
Combining 3D GIS and AR can revolutionize how we understand spatial data in real environments, offering more immersive and intuitive experiences.
