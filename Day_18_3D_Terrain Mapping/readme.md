# 3D Terrain Mapping with Three.js and WebGL

## About the Project

### 3D Terrain Mapping
3D Terrain Mapping is a **Geographic Information System (GIS)** technique used to visualize the Earth's surface in three dimensions. It involves creating a digital representation of terrain surfaces, which can be applied to various fields such as:
- **Urban Planning**
- **Landscape Analysis**
- **Environmental Studies**

By leveraging **3D models**, users gain a more intuitive understanding of topography, elevations, and landforms.

### Procedural Terrain Using Three.js and WebGL
This project explores **3D visualization and interactivity** with procedural terrain, created using **Three.js** and **WebGL**. While not based on real-world data, the terr**ain is dynamically generated with:
- **Custom shaders** for textures and topography.
- **Real-time rendering effects** such as shadows, reflections, and lighting.

---

## Highlights
- **Custom Shaders**: Applies textures like sand, grass, and snow to simulate realistic terrain.
- **Real-Time Rendering**: Includes advanced effects like shadows, reflections, and lighting for enhanced visual realism.

## Next Steps

### Integrating Real-World GIS Data
- Use **Mapbox** or **Google Maps Elevation API** to create terrains from actual geospatial data.

### Augmented Reality (AR)
- Implement AR using **WebXR** to enable **interactive, real-world overlays** of terrains and geospatial layers.

## Why It Matters
Combining **3D GIS** and **AR** can revolutionize how spatial data is understood and used in real environments. This approach offers:
- Immersive experiences.
- Intuitive ways to explore and analyze spatial data.
