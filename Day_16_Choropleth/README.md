# Analyzing Innovation Barriers Through Health Prevalence
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between innovation barriers and health prevalence across different states. By examining patent counts and health data, we can identify potential correlations and insights.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis is sourced from the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention - PLACES: Local Data for Better Health](https://places.cdc.gov/?view=county).
- **Patents Data**: Contains the number of patents filed in each state.
- **Health Prevalence Data**: Contains health prevalence statistics for various conditions across states.

## Files
- `BARRIERCOUNT.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and visualization.
- `combineddd_patents.csv`: CSV file with patent counts by state.
- `Crude_Prevelance.csv`: CSV file with health prevalence data.

## Installation
To run the analysis, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy folium
```

## Usage
1. Open the `BARRIERCOUNT.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run the cells to load the data, perform the analysis, and generate visualizations.

## Results
The results of the analysis will be displayed in the notebook, including aggregated patent counts by state and any identified correlations with health prevalence data.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into how health prevalence may impact innovation across different regions, helping to identify areas where health interventions could potentially foster greater innovation.
